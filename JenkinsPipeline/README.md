### Overview
This repository hosts a Jenkins Pipeline script specifically tailored for automating the testing procedures of AQ-G257 protection relays, which are crucial components in modern electrical infrastructure systems. The pipeline facilitates a comprehensive testing environment that automates the lifecycle of software testing from code checkout to deployment and validation.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this pipeline is to streamline and enhance the testing process for AQ-G257 protection relays, ensuring each unit meets rigorous quality standards before deployment. By automating tasks such as building, testing, configuration, and deployment, the pipeline minimizes human error and maximizes efficiency, making it an invaluable tool for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

### Functionality
The pipeline is engineered to handle multiple tasks dynamically based on configurable parameters, allowing for a flexible testing process tailored to the specific needs of each build. Key functionalities include:

- Dynamic Source Code Management: Code is checked out based on specified parameters, supporting multiple scenarios and testing requirements.
- Automated Builds and Tests: The system automatically compiles firmware, runs preliminary tests, and ensures that all software components function seamlessly together.
- Enhanced Test Execution: It employs the Robot Framework to conduct detailed automated tests, capturing nuanced performance metrics and operational integrity.
- Condition-Based Workflow Execution: Each stage of the pipeline can be conditionally executed based on the project's current requirements, ensuring resource optimization.
- Result Compilation and Reporting: Post-execution, the pipeline aggregates results and presents them in an easily digestible format, aiding in quick decision-making and continuous improvement.
